### TODO
- CI (auto-tests)
    - GitHub actions for python package 
        - Need to trigger on push from : 
            - feature to feature
            - Feature_X to dev
            - dev to stable

- Pre-commit (linters)
    - flake-8
    - black

- GitLab connection (for issue creation, release and branching. Except if Github issues and actions are sufficient)
- Fundamentals integration (data source gathering, minimal backtesting setup, architecture and signatures to simply interface strategies, data and backtesting)
    - Inspirations for backtesting libs, methods and architecture :

# Algorithmic Trading Repository

Welcome to the Algorithmic Trading repository! This repository aims to provide tools, models, and strategies for algorithmic trading, inspired by concepts from the book "Machine Learning For Algorithmic Trading" by Stefan Jansen.

## Overview

Algorithmic trading refers to the use of computer algorithms to automate the process of trading financial assets. It involves the use of mathematical models and statistical techniques to make trading decisions. This repository provides resources to facilitate algorithmic trading, including backtesting tools, research models, and strategies.

## Components

### Backtesting

The `backtesting` component of this repository includes tools and scripts for evaluating the performance of trading strategies using historical data. Backtesting is crucial for assessing the viability and effectiveness of trading algorithms before deploying them in live markets. In this section, you'll find utilities to simulate trades, calculate performance metrics, and visualize results.

### Research

The `research` component of this repository is further divided into two subcomponents: `Models` and `Strategy`.

#### Models

The `Models` subcomponent contains implementations of various machine learning models used in algorithmic trading. These models are designed to analyze market data, identify patterns, and make predictions about future price movements. Examples include regression models, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

#### Strategy

The `Strategy` subcomponent focuses on developing and testing trading strategies based on the insights derived from the machine learning models. Strategies may involve signals generated by the models, technical indicators, or fundamental analysis. This section includes scripts for strategy development, optimization, and performance evaluation.

## Usage

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the `backtesting` directory to familiarize yourself with the backtesting tools.
3. Dive into the `research` directory to examine the machine learning models and trading strategies.
4. Experiment with different models and strategies using historical market data.
5. Modify and customize the provided scripts to suit your trading preferences and objectives.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, new features, or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request. Additionally, suggestions for additional models or strategies inspired by "Machine Learning For Algorithmic Trading" are appreciated.
